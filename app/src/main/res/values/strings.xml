Nas frias terras das Geleiras Eternas, no leste da Sibéria, Hyoga torna-se Cavaleiro tendo como mestre Camus, o Cavaleiro de Ouro de Aquário, que manipula o frio. Seguindo os ensinamentos do seu mestre, ele tenta manter-se racional diante de tudo, mas possui um lado emotivo que não consegue abandonar.</string>


    <string name="hyoga_bio">In the manga, Hyōga originally did not choose to participate in the Graude Foundation\'s Galaxian Wars until he received an order from Sanctuary to assassinate the other bronze saints. He originally accepted this due to his hatred for the Graude Foundation, being aware that Mitsumasa Kido was his father. As he became more familiar with his subjects, however, Hyōga grew indecisive about his mission. Once Silver saints began to target him along with the other bronze saints, however, he dropped his allegiance to Sanctuary. His rage towards Sanctuary boiled after his master Camus made an unexpected visit to Siberia to sent his mother\'s ship deep into the ocean\'s abyss.</string>
